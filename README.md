# Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects

Short descriptions and links to the reports for the eight projects which are part of a two terms nanodegree in data analysis with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The goals of the program is to learn how to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. The work is performed in Python, R, SQL and Tableau. The presentations are written in Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook and in R-Studio.

## Explore Weather Trends

This project presents an analysis of local and global temperatures for a period of more than 250 years. The global temperatures trends are compared with local trends for Columbus (Ohio, US) and two other cities: Madrid (Spain) and Helsinki (Finland). This presentation is written in Jupyter Notebook, on a Windows 7 Professional system. The basic steps of data wrangling were performed using Google sheets.
