# Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects

Short descriptions and links to the reports for the eight projects which are part of a two terms nanodegree in data analysis with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). The goals of the program is to learn how to organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. The work is performed in Python, R, SQL and Tableau. The presentations are written in Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook and in R-Studio.

## Explore Weather Trends

This project presents an analysis of local and global temperatures for a period of more than 250 years. The global temperatures trends are compared with local trends for Columbus (Ohio, US) and two other cities: Madrid (Spain) and Helsinki (Finland). 

This presentation is written in Jupyter Notebook, on a Windows 7 Professional system. The basic steps of data wrangling were performed using Google sheets.

## 2016 US Bike Share Activity Snapshot
An exploratory analysis on data from [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States is performed. The system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington (DC) are compared. The differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users are also analysed.

The project is completely done in Jupyter Notebook, using Python 3 and Matplotlib for visualizations. A notebook kernel is provided by Udacity and it has the information required for the completion of the project. It also contains questions and several blocks of code that guide the analysis of the data.

## Investigate the TMDb movie dataset

Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Complete the entire data analysis process, start by posing a question and finish by sharing the findings.

The dataset analysed here contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database [TMDb](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb) on Kaggle. It is investigated how various factors, such as budget, release time, genre, influence the revenue and the ratings of the movie. The dataset is assessed, cleaned and formatted. Exploratory data analysis is performed and visualizations are constructed. 

_The work is done in Jupyter Notebook, using a kernel provided by Udacity. The code is written in Python 3, using Pandas and NumPy._
