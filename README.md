# Data Analyst Nanodegree Projects

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SolanaO/dand_udacity/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Explore Weather Trends

This project presents an analysis of local and global temperatures for a period of more than 250 years. The global temperatures trends are compared with local trends for Columbus (Ohio, US) and two other cities: Madrid (Spain) and Helsinki (Finland). This presentation is written in Jupyter Notebook, on a Windows 7 Professional system. The basic steps of data wrangling were performed using Google sheets.
